# Why?
![Animated Parrot](.github/anim_parrot.gif)     
An image is worth a thousand words, therefore a animated parrot gif must be worth a million . This module is there so your players can react to chat messages / rolls or just anything with more than just words.

# Current Features
 - Adds Emoji Picker to Chat items / rolls
 - Loads Custom Emojis from a dedicated emoji folder and adds them to the picker
 - Loads Custom Emojis from "Emoji Packs" that can be installed as side modules (no scripting required)

# Development Instructions From the Template:
About Bundler:  
This project uses webpack to bundle your files. What this means is that every script file in src/ will get 'bundled' into one output .js file in dist/.
Likewise every static file (.html, .json, etc.) in static/ will get moved to dist.  
Because of this you should NOT have your development working directory inside the foundryuser folder. Instead you should follow the instructions below
for setting up symantic links between the dist/ folder and foundryuser.


- Run npm install
- Rename module.ts to your chosen module name.
- Rename the references to module.ts in webpack.config.js file. (Line 26)
- Fill in module.json with actual information.
- run: npm run build  
- Create a symantic link between the dist/ folder to a module folder in FoundryUser/Data/modules/[MODULE_NAME]  
--	Instructions (for windows) 
--	Open a command prompt and navigate to FoundryUser/Data/modules   
--	Run: mklink /D MODULE_NAME [DEVELOPMENT_PATH]/dist  

A note on typescript, it is completely optional and if you do not wish to use then rename any .ts files and their references to .js.
